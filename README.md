# ChartExample

Used the downloaded project from [this website](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qeuy5konx1429jd/DataVisualization%20Chart.rar?dl=0) as a starting point.  Found it through a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xs7JNW549o&t=195s) video.

Changed the data to be random in a range.  Need to figure out some different color schemes if going to stick with random data.  Will probably use other functions as data.  Figured this was a good way to start.  Original data is commented out.  The original loop was from 0 to 21, so 20 data points.

Project was started to show a student how to output data visually using forms and C#.

Project is a VS 2022 project.
